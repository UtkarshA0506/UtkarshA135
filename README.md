I am also into Problem Solving . I frequently participate in events related to Competitive Programming , with max rating of 1525 on codechef and 6 star on Hackerrank .

I frequently participate in Hackathons and I am proud to say my team "Useless Developers" has won consecutive 5 hackathons in a month. To name a few - IOSD-NSUT , WIE Ideathon , CODE RIT hackathon and ReImagine-Waste Hackathon.

A Flutter App , but with a blend of Machine Learning in it and intergrated with a whole lot of features which makes it probably the best of the apps I have worked so far.
So basically I along with a bunch of seniors from my college have built this "KisanSeva" app - a one stop for Farmers of India who are facing a whole lot issues nowadays .
