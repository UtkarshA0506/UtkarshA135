### Hello Amigos ðŸ‘‹

I am a CSE Sophomore at MSRIT.

I am a quick learner, dedicated coder and a developer. From over an year I have been constantly developing mobile based applications in Flutter . I have recently started Web development . I have worked with HTML , CSS , Bootstrap , Dart , C , C++ and Java with a little knowledge of Swift.

I am also into Problem Solving . I frequently participate in events related to Competitive Programming , with max rating of 1525 on codechef and 6 star on Hackerrank .

I frequently participate in Hackathons and I am proud to say my team "Useless Developers" has won consecutive 5 hackathons in a month. To name a few - IOSD-NSUT , WIE Ideathon , CODE RIT hackathon and ReImagine-Waste Hackathon.

I have worked with numerous Projects on Flutter.

### Top Projects :
- [KisanSeva](https://github.com/UtkarshA135/kisanseva)
A Flutter App , but with a blend of Machine Learning in it and intergrated with a whole lot of features which makes it probably the best of the apps I have worked so far.
So basically I along with a bunch of seniors from my college have built this "KisanSeva" app - a one stop for Farmers of India who are facing a whole lot issues nowadays .

App has multiple features -
1- Secured Authentication (via OTP)
2- Multilingual for efficient use
2- Rent tools / farming essentials
3- Plant disease detection
4- Crop prediction
5- Smart connect to prevent third party person take advantage
6- Know the Weather
7- Feed
8- Toll free number/ expert assistance

The best thing about the app is its built in 10 days !!!

-[Healthician - Pharmacy in your hands](https://github.com/UtkarshA135/)
Keeping in mind above points we have decided to make Healthician .Healthify is focused to cover almost all aspects related to Healthcare in a single app.Healthician has 8 categories -
1-Covid detection through lung x-ray using a Kaggle dataset and embedding in the flutter app through Tensorflow.
2- Yoga posture correction - a personal AI based assistant to detect poses using POSENET technology and image processing to calculate the correctness of the pose using another kaggle dataset.
3-Doctor Patient interaction like video calls , appointments , nearest pharmacy through Google maps API and medicine based on symptoms.
4-BMI calculation since maintaining a good physique is as much important.
5- Donate blood and plasma.
6-Symptoms Detector using Infermedica API.
7-Medicine Reminder - people forget to take medicine on time which can have unwanted consequences.
8-Mental Health- let's talk to end depression.
