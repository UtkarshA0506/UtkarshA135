### Hello Amigos ðŸ‘‹

I am a CSE Sophomore at MSRIT.

I am a quick learner, dedicated coder and a developer. From over an year I have been constantly developing mobile based applications in Flutter . I have recently started Web development . I have worked with HTML , CSS , Bootstrap , Dart , C , C++ and Java with a little knowledge of Swift.

I am also into Problem Solving . I frequently participate in events related to Competitive Programming , with max rating of 1525 on codechef and 6 star on Hackerrank .

I frequently participate in Hackathons and I am proud to say my team "Useless Developers" has won consecutive 5 hackathons in a month. To name a few - IOSD-NSUT , WIE Ideathon , CODE RIT hackathon and ReImagine-Waste Hackathon.

I have worked with numerous Projects on Flutter.

### Top Projects :
- [KisanSeva](https://github.com/UtkarshA135/kisanseva)
A Flutter App , but with a blend of Machine Learning in it and intergrated with a whole lot of features which makes it probably the best of the apps I have worked so far.
So basically I along with a bunch of seniors from my college have built this "KisanSeva" app - a one stop for Farmers of India who are facing a whole lot issues nowadays .
